The loss of these supplies would deal a major blow to Syndikat's operations and may just flush Warlock out into the open.</English>
            <Portuguese>Tocazul nos informou sobre uma grande %2fábrica do Syndikat disfarçada de madeireira%1 no centro de Tanoa. Imagens de satélite recentes sugerem que um grande carregamento de armas e suprimentos acabou de chegar e está a caminho do imenso território controlado pelo Syndikat. A perda desses suprimentos representaria um grande dano nas operações do Syndikat, e talvez consiga induzir o Mandinga a se revelar.</Portuguese>
            <Korean>블루캡이 Tanoa 중심부에 재목 저장소로 위장한 주요 %2Syndikat 시설이 있다고 알려줬다. 최근 위성 이미지에 따르면, 대규모 무기와 보급품 선적이 Syndikat 지배 진영에서 꽤 먼 곳으로 들어오는 것으로 확인됐다. 이런 보급품을 잃게 되면, Syndikat의 작전에 막대한 피해를 입힐 것이며 워록이 그 모습을 드러낼 것이다.</Korean>
            <Chinesesimp>蓝帽向我们表明有一处%2伪装成储木场的辛迪加设施%1, 坐落于Tanoa的中部. 根据最近的卫星照片表明, 该设施有一大批货刚进去那里, 举凡武器与补给品等等, 藏在他们领地的深处. 失去这些物资肯定会造成辛迪加一个严重的打击, 或许还能把术士从他的藏身处给逼出来.</Chinesesimp>
            <Japanese>ブルーキャップからの情報だが、タノア中心部に%2材木置き場として偽装された大規模なSyndikat施設%1が存在している。直近の衛星画像によれば、大量の武器と物資が運び込まれてきたばかりのようだ。これらは最終的にSyndikat勢力圏内の隅々に行き渡るものと思われる。これを失えばSyndikatの活動は大きな打撃を被ることになる。そうなればウォーロックを表へ引きずり出せる可能性がある。</Japanese>

Нам нельзя упускать эту возможность.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Это место хорошо охраняется и находится глубоко на территории Syndikat, поэтому стоит ожидать значительного присутствия противника.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Однако мы можем использовать элемент неожиданности. Если мы будем действовать быстро, то мы сможем застать их врасплох.</Russian>
            <German>Nach unserem Angriff auf Syndikats Versorgungslinien hat uns Blue Cap darüber informiert, dass Warlock die Führungsebene von Syndikat zu einem Treffen in einem %1Lagerhaus%2 in der Nähe des Dorfes %3Namuvaka%2 zusammenberufen hat. Dies ist eine Gelegenheit, die wir uns nicht entgehen lassen dürfen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die Anlage ist schwer bewacht und liegt im Syndikat-Territorium, also sollten Sie mit zahlreichen feindlichen Streitkräften rechnen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wir haben das Überraschungsmoment auf unserer Seite, also nutzen Sie es! Wenn wir schnell sind, können wir sie auf dem falschen Fuß erwischen.</German>
            <Czech>Blue Cap nás informoval, že Warlock po našem útoku na zásobovací trasy Syndikatu svolal schůzku vedení Syndikatu v %1bezpečném úkrytu%2 poblíž vesnice %3Namuvaka%2. Naskýtá se nám tak příležitost, kterou si nemůžeme dovolit propásnout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pozice je přísně střežená a nachází se na území Syndikatu, takže očekávejte, že se tam budou vyskytovat dost velké počty nepřátel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Máme na své straně moment překvapení, tak to využijme. Pokud budeme dost rychlí, zvládneme je zasáhnout nepřipravené.</Czech>
            <English>Following our assault on Syndikat's supply lines, Blue Cap informed us that Warlock has called a meeting of Syndikat leadership at a %1safehouse%2 near the village of %3Namuvaka%2. This presents us with an opportunity we can't afford to pass up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The location is heavily guarded and lies within Syndikat territory, so expect a sizable enemy presence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have the element of surprise, so let's use it. If we're quick, we'll be able to catch them off guard.</English>
            <Portuguese>Após o ataque às linhas de suprimento do Syndikat, Tocazul nos informou que o Mandinga convocou uma reunião das lideranças do Syndikat no %1depósito%2 próximo à vila de %3Namuvaka%2. Esta é uma oportunidade que não podemos deixar de lado.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Como o local está fortemente guardado e fica no território do Syndikat, prepare-se para uma quantidade considerável de inimigos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;O elemento surpresa nos favorece, então vamos aproveitar. Se formos rápidos, vamos conseguir pegá-los desprevenidos.</Portuguese>
            <Korean>우리가 Syndikat의 보급품 라인을 공격한 이후, 블루캡에 따르면 워록이 %3나무바카%2 마을 인근의 %1안전가옥%2에서 Syndikat의 지도부와 회담을 요청했다고 한다. 하지만, 우리는 기회를 이용할 만한 능력이 부족하다.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;이 지역은 중무장 지역으로 Syndikat 진영에 속하기 때문에 방대한 규모의 적의 병력이 예상된다.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;단, 우리는 놀랄만한 병력을 보유하고 있으므로, 이를 활용할 거다. 서두르면, 놈들을 경비로부터 붙잡을 수 있을 거다.</Korean>
            <Chinesesimp>在我们打击完辛迪加的补给线后, 蓝帽跟我们表明术士他即将与其他部下一起在%3Namuvaka%2附近村庄里的%1安全屋%2开会. 这对我们来说是个大好机会.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;该地为重兵把守的辛迪加领土, 所以预期会遭遇到很多敌人.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;我们有着偷袭的优势, 让我们来好好利用它. 假如我们手脚够快的话, 便能在他们有所反应之前就逮到他们.</Chinesesimp>
            <Japanese>ブルーキャップからの情報によれば、我々のSyndikatの補給線に対する攻撃の後、ウォーロックは%3ナムバカ%2村の周囲に位置する%1アジト%2でのSyndikat指導部の会合を命じたとのことだ。となれば我々にとってとても見逃せないチャンスとなる。&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;この地域における防備は固く、またSyndikat勢力圏内にあるため、相当規模の敵勢力が予想される。&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;だがこちらには奇襲という利点がある。それを活かすとしよう。素早く動けば奴らの隙を突くことができる。</Japanese>

            <Original>Yesterday evening, Syndikat forces launched an offensive against Viper's presence on Tanoa, culminating in their theft of the Eastwind Device. Though we've been monitoring Syndikat movements extensively over the past 24 hours, observing a significant increase in their activity across the island, the whereabouts of the Device have remained unknown. Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier today, the %2Blue Pearl Industrial Port%1 was attacked and occupied by a large Syndikat force. Intel confirms the presence of both Warlock and the %4Eastwind Device%3 itself. The Device is being kept under heavy guard in the northern sector, and we believe Warlock has agreed to ransom it back to Viper. As a contingency, Warlock has armed the Device, with himself the sole holder of the disarm codes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of Syndikat's and Viper's motives, it's clear that we must secure the Eastwind Device before the situation escalates.</Original>
            <Chinese>昨天傍晚, 辛迪加對Tanoa上的毒蛇展開進攻, 最終偷到了東風裝置. 儘管在過去的24小時裡我們不斷監視著辛迪加的動態, 且島上的活動也有明顯的增加, 但我們還是一直無法確認到東風裝置的下落. 直到現在.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;早些時候, 一支龐大的辛迪加部隊進攻並佔領了%2藍珍珠工業港%1. 情報顯示術士與%4東風裝置%3皆有出現. 該裝置被重兵把守在港口的北區, 而且我們相信術士已經準備讓毒蛇他們贖回這個裝置. 作為備案, 術士已經啟動了裝置, 而他也是唯一一個擁有關閉密碼的人.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;不管他們雙方的動機為何, 我們都得搶在狀況更糟之前就把裝置搶到手.</Chinese>
            <French>Hier soir, les forces du Syndikat ont lancé une offensive contre Viper sur Tanoa. Le Syndikat s'est emparé du Vent d'Est. Notre surveillance renforcée des mouvements du Syndikat de ces dernières 24 heures a permis de constater une augmentation considérable de l'activité du Syndikat, mais nous n'étions pas en mesure de localiser l'appareil. Jusqu'à présent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aujourd'hui, des troupes du Syndikat ont attaqué le %2port industriel de Blue Pearl%1 et l'occupent encore. Nos renseignements confirment la présence de Warlock et du %4Vent d'Est%3. L'appareil se trouve dans le secteur nord, sous bonne garde. Nous pensons que Warlock a accepté de le rendre à Viper, contre rançon. Pour se prémunir de toute mauvaise surprise, Warlock a armé l'appareil et il est le seul à en détenir les codes de désactivation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quels que soient les objectifs du Syndikat et de Viper, nous devons sécuriser le Vent d'Est avant que la situation ne dégénère.</French>
            <Spanish>Ayer por la tarde, tropas del Syndikat atacaron a los miembros de Viper presentes en Tanoa y les robaron el dispositivo Viento del este. Hemos controlado los movimientos de Syndikat durante las últimas 24 horas y hemos observado un importante aumento de su presencia en la isla, pero el paradero del dispositivo seguía siendo desconocido. Hasta ahora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A primera hora de hoy, el %2puerto industrial de Blue Pearl%1 fue atacado y tomado por un gran número de tropas Syndikat. Inteligencia confirma la presencia de Warlock y del propio dispositivo %4Viento del este%3. El dispositivo se encuentra bajo fuerte custodia en el sector norte. Creemos que Warlock ha prometido devolvérselo a Viper a cambio de una compensación económica. Como medida preventiva, Warlock ha activado el dispositivo y es el único que conoce los códigos de desactivación.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Independientemente de los motivos de Syndikat o de Viper, es evidente que debemos recuperar el dispositivo Viento del este antes de que la situación empeore.</Spanish>
            <Italian>Ieri sera le forze Syndikat hanno lanciato un'offensiva contro la presenza dei Viper su Tanoa, culminata nel furto del dispositivo Vento dell'est. Sebbene avessimo monitorato senza sosta i movimenti dei Syndikat nel corso delle ultime 24 ore, osservando un aumento significativo delle loro attività sull'isola, non è chiaro dove si trovi il dispositivo. Fino ad ora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oggi il %2porto industriale Blue Port%1 è stato attaccato e occupato da una grande forza Syndikat. Secondo le informazioni, Warlock e il dispositivo %4Vento dell'est%3 si trovano in questo luogo. Il dispositivo è sotto stretta sorveglianza nel settore settentrionale e riteniamo che Warlock abbia concordato di chiedere un riscatto ai Viper. Warlock ha inoltre armato il dispositivo ed è l'unico che possiede i codici di disarmo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A prescindere dai moventi dei Viper e dei Syndikat, è chiaro che dobbiamo mettere al sicuro il dispositivo Vento dell'est prima che la situazione sfugga di mano.</Italian>
            <Polish>Wczoraj wieczorem Syndikat rozpoczął ofensywę przeciwko obecności Vipera na Tanoa i ukradł urządzenie „Wschodni wiatr”. Przez minione 24 godziny intensywnie obserwowaliśmy ruchy Syndikatu. Zauważyliśmy wzrost aktywności na wyspie, ale położenie urządzenia wciąż nie było znane. Aż do teraz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dzisiaj %2port przemysłowy Blue Pearl%1 został zaatakowany i przejęty przez dużą grupę sił Syndikatu. Wywiad potwierdza obecność zarówno Warlocka, jak i %4„Wschodniego wiatru”%3. Urządzenie jest ściśle strzeżone w północnym sektorze. Mamy powody przypuszczać, że Warlock zgodził się oddać je Viperowi za okup. Warlock prawdopodobnie uzbroił urządzenie i sam jest w posiadaniu kodów dezaktywacyjnych.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Niezależnie od motywów Syndikatu czy Vipera musimy zabezpieczyć „Wschodni wiatr”, zanim sytuacja ulegnie eskalacji.</Polish>
            <Russian>Вчера вечером силы Syndikat начали наступление на позиции Viper на Таноа. Кульминацией стал захват устройства «Восточный ветер». Хотя мы постоянно следили за передвижениями Syndikat за последние 24 часа, наблюдая повышенную активность на острове, местонахождение устройства оставалось неизвестным. До этого момента.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Сегодня промышленный порт %2Blue Pearl%1 был атакован и оккупирован крупным силами Syndikat. Разведданные подтверждают как местоположение Ворлока, так и самого устройства %4«Восточный ветер»%3. Устройство находится в северном секторе и хорошо охраняется. Мы полагаем, что Ворлок хочет потребовать у Viper выкуп за него. В целях предосторожности Ворлок зарядил устройство, оставив у себя коды для его обезвреживания.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Какими бы ни были мотивы Syndikat и Viper, ясно, что нам необходимо перехватить устройство «Восточный ветер», прежде чем ситуация обострится.</Russian>
            <German>Gestern Abend haben Syndikat-Streitkräfte eine Offensive gegen die auf Tanoa stationierten Viper-Streitkräfte gestartet, wodurch das Ostwind-Gerät in ihre Hände gelang. Obwohl wir Syndikats Truppenbewegungen in den vergangenen 24 Stunden aufmerksam verfolgt haben und vermehrte Aktivitäten feststellen konnten, war uns der Standort des Gerätes nicht bekannt. Bis jetzt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heute Morgen wurde der %2Industriehafen Blue Pearl%1 von zahlreichen Syndikat-Streitkräften angegriffen und besetzt. Laut unseren Informationen befinden sich sowohl Warlock als auch das %4Ostwind-Gerät%3 dort. Das Gerät befindet sich im nördlichen Sektor und wird schwer bewacht. Wir glauben, dass Warlock es an Viper zurückverkaufen will. Als Notfallplan hat Warlock das Gerät scharfgemacht und ist selbst als einziger im Besitz der Entschärfungscodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unabhängig von Syndikats und Vipers Agenda müssen wir das Ostwind-Gerät sichern, bevor die Situation eskaliert.</German>
            <Czech>Včera večer jednotky Syndikatu zahájily útok na operativce Viper na Tanoi a jejich snahy vyvrcholily krádeží zařízení Východní vítr. I když jsme počínání Syndikatu za posledních 24 hodin rozsáhle monitorovali a pozorovali významné zvýšení jejich aktivity po celém ostrově, nepodařilo se nám zjistit, kam zařízení odnesli. Až doteď.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dnes o pár hodin dříve byl napaden %2průmyslový přístav Blue Pearl%1, který teď obsadila velká jednotka Syndikatu. Informace potvrzují, že se tam nachází Warlock i samotné %4zařízení Východní vítr%3. Zařízení je přísně střeženo v severním sektoru a my věříme, že Warlock hodlá předat zařízení zpátky Viperu, až od nich dostane výkupné. Pro všechny případy zařízení odjistil. Warlock je jediný, kdo u sebe má deaktivační kódy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ať už jsou motivy Syndikatu a Viperu jakékoliv, je jasné, že musíme zařízení Východní vítr zajistit dříve, než se situace vyhrotí.</Czech>

            <Portuguese>Na noite de ontem, as forças do Syndikat lançaram uma ofensiva contra a presença da Viper em Tanoa, culminando no roubo do dispositivo Vento do Leste. Apesar de estarmos monitorando extensivamente os movimentos do Syndikat nas últimas 24 horas, e observando um aumento significativo de sua atividade na ilha, o paradeiro do dispositivo continua desconhecido. Até agora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Hoje mais cedo, o %2porto industrial Blue Pearl%1 foi atacado e ocupado por uma imensa força do Syndikat. Nossa inteligência confirmou a presença do Mandinga e do próprio Dispositivo %4Vento do Leste%3. O dispositivo está sendo mantido sob forte vigilância no setor norte, e acreditamos que o Mandinga acertou um resgate para devolvê-lo à Viper. Como medida de contingência, o Mandinga armou o dispositivo e é o único que possui os códigos de desarmamento.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Independente das razões do Syndikat e da Viper, está claro que devemos recuperar o dispositivo Vento do Leste antes que a situação piore.</Portuguese>
            <Korean>어제 저녁, Syndikat군이 Tanoa에 출현한 Viper에 대한 공격을 개시하여 동풍 장치를 훔치는 작업을 대대적으로 벌였다. 지난 24시간 동안 Syndikat의 움직임을 광범위하게 감시하고 있었지만, 놈들의 활동이 섬 전체에서 급증하는 것이 관측되었으며, 동풍 장치의 행방이 파악되지 않았다. 지금까지.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;오늘 아침 일찌기 Blue Pearl 산업용 항구 가 대규모 Syndikat군에 의해 공격 및 점령당했다. 정보원이 워록과 동풍 장치의 존재를 파악하였다. 이 장치는 북쪽 부근에서 엄호 아래 보호되고 있으며, 우리는 워록이 이 장치의 몸 값을 걸어 Viper에게 되찾아 줄 것을 동의했다고 본다. 워록은 만일의 사태에 대비해 본인만이 무장해제 암호를 풀 수 있도록 이 장치를 무장시켰다.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Syndikat와 Viper의 동기와 상관 없이, 우리는 무슨 일이 있어도 이 상황이 더 악화되기 전에 동풍 장치를 확보해야 한다. </Korean>
            <Chinesesimp>昨天傍晚, 辛迪加对Tanoa上的毒蛇展开进攻, 最终偷到了东风装置. 尽管在过去的24小时里我们不断监视着辛迪加的动态, 且岛上的活动也有明显的增加, 但我们还是一直无法确认到东风装置的下落. 直到现在.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;早些时候, 一支庞大的辛迪加部队进攻并占领了%2蓝珍珠工业港%1. 情报显示术士与%4东风装置%3皆有出现. 该装置被重兵把守在港口的北区, 而且我们相信术士已经准备让毒蛇他们赎回这个装置. 作为备案, 术士已经启动了装置, 而他也是唯一一个拥有关闭密码的人.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;不管他们双方的动机为何, 我们都得抢在状况更糟之前就把装置抢到手.</Chinesesimp>
            <Japanese>昨晩、Syndikatの部隊がタノアにおけるViper部隊に対して攻撃を実施。「イーストウィンド」装置がSyndikatに奪取されるに至った。我々は過去24時間Syndikatの動向を監視し続けてきたが、島全土における活動量の大幅な増加は確認できたものの、同装置の位置特定には至らなかった。だがそれも先程までだ。.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;先刻、Blue Pearl工業港が大規模なSyndikat部隊に襲撃・占拠された。そこにウォーロックならびに「イーストウィンド」装置そのものの存在が確認されている。この装置は北区域で厳重に警備されており、ウォーロックが身代金と交換でViperへ引き渡す取引を交わしたものと思われる。またウォーロックは次善の策として同装置の安全装置を解除しており、その解除コードはウォーロック自身が持っている。&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SyndikatおよびViperの目的が何であれ、状況がこれ以上悪化する前に「イーストウィンド」装置を確保しなければならないのは自明の理だ。</Japanese>
